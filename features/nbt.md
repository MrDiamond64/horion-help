# NBT

## What is NBT?

NBT, or Named Binary Tag, is the data of a block or item that is changable using inventory editors, like Horion and MCEdit. Using Horion, you need to copy text from either a message or a file downloaded from online containing the correct Horion NBT format.

# How do you identify an NBT type

First, lets explain what I mean by "NBT type". There are `.nbt load` and `.nbt write` NBTs.
A simple example of this is the following

- ```{Count:64b,Name:"wooden_sword",tag:{Unbreakable:1b}}``` 

or 

- ```{Unbreakable:1b}```
