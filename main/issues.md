# Issues

The following is a list of known issues

  - Game crashes when disabling blink
  - Insta break does not work on realms
  - NoFall doesn't work on realms
  - Reach only extends by one block
  - Taking fall damage when flying, impossible to fix since fall damage is now server sided, meaning no way to change it
  - Damage crashes game, uses fall damage so it won't work anyways
  - Tracer with hitbox breaks tracer, only solution is to die
  - Hitbox does not reset immediately, you need to change dimensions, kill the user, or die to change it back
  - Scaffold crashes when shut off
  - .nbt will sometimes not work. If given an error like "invalid nbt", try a different nbt command. For example, `.nbt load` or `.give shulker_box 1 0 1`. If the nbt gives a different error or isn't fixed with a different command, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/horion) and ask for help in the nbt chat

if the injector says "can't find a download link" or "DLL broken" download the [dll](https://horion.download/dll) and [xtreme injector](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=21570&act=down&actionhash=1639347436-42eecac7227064b0601d22c3ff1b1425a2056af7) or [Fate injector](https://github.com/fligger/FateInjector/releases/tag/1.0)

Your antivirus, chrome, or other service may stop you from accessing the horion page or downloading the injectors or dll. If this happens, read what the page says for clues, they usually have instructions to add the page or file to your exceptions. If chrome blocks your download, press `ctrl+j` and resume the download from there. Another issue that may arise is a vpn. Some vpns have an option to block sites they think are dangerous, so you will either have to shut the vpn off, shut the setting off, or add the site as an exception.

If you have an issue that isn't on the list join the [discord](https://discord.gg/horion)
